### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm Giannis and have my origins in Heraklion of Crete. ðŸ‡¬ðŸ‡· Following a brief description of my background and experience gained. I studied Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics at the University of Sunderland and currently I'm doing my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Northumbria. During my studies, I worked on a variety of projects. One of them was the development of a slideshow application that uses a folder of images to present them in an organized way with features like auto-scaling, brightening, and transitions.
