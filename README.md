### Hey, I'm Giannis! 👾

I have my origins in Heraklion of Crete. 🇬🇷 
I studied Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics at the University of Sunderland and currently I'm doing my Master's degree in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Northumbria. During my studies, I worked on a variety of projects. One of them was the development of a slideshow application that uses a folder of images to present them in an organized way with features like auto-scaling, brightening, and transitions.
